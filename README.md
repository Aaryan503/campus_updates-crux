# campus_updates-crux
My first App Dev project, on flutter, for crux inductions. This is basically just an app for updates on events that are happening and I am trying to incorporate some new features
The app just serves as an alternate to view different events happening in campus and filter them. Club Admins can add events of their own club respectively, along with description and timings. The user can tap on an event to view about it. The user also has to create an account on the platform wherein by default they will be assigned as a guest, and they have to verify their email via a link sent on mail.
I am planning to add a few more functionalities, like searching for events, and registering for the events.
If you want admin privileges just modify code from 'guest' to 'admin' before logging in. Otherwise you can dm me and I can make the necessary changes in firebase. I tried to include automatic roles but I couldn't figure out how to automically just give the roles to club admins emails, manually changing them on firebase seemed like a much better option atleast at this scale.
